# DayOne-Python Learning
## The first day of my Python 30-day challenge.

The requirements for the first day, from "*Total Python: You Can Master Python Programming in 16 Days*" on Udemy can be seen below:

>*You're going to create Python code that asks your friend to answer two questions that
require a single word each and then displays those combined words on the screen to
form a creative brand.*

The challenge focuses on the __*input*__ and __*print*__ functions for the day.
As the days go by, I will be coming back to this project to update it and add any other knowledge I learned after it
