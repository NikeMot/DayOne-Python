# 16 Day Python Learning Challenge
## Learning Python via small projects

## Day One 
The requirements for the first day, from "*Total Python: You Can Master Python Programming in 16 Days*" on Udemy can be seen below:

>*You're going to create Python code that asks your friend to answer two questions that
require a single word each and then displays those combined words on the screen to
form a creative brand.*

The challenge focuses on the __*input*__ and __*print*__ functions for the day.
As the days go by, I will be coming back to this project to update it and add any other knowledge I learned after it 

## Day Two 

The requirements for the second day, from "*Total Python: You Can Master Python Programming in 16 Days*" on Udemy can be seen below:

>*The situation is this: You work in a company where salespeople receive 13%
commissions on their total sales, and your boss wants you to help the salespeople
calculate their commissions by creating a program that asks them their name and
how much they've sold this month.
Your program will answer them with a sentence that includes their name and the
amount of commissions they are entitled to*

The challenge focuses on __*mathematical operators*__ and the __*round*__ function for the day.


## Day Three 

The requirements for the third day, from "*Total Python: You Can Master Python Programming in 16 Days*" on Udemy can be seen below:

>*The task is as follows: You are going to create a program that first asks the user to
enter text. It can be any text, an entire article, a paragraph, a sentence, a poem,
whatever you want. Then the program will ask the user to enter three random letters.
From that moment on, our code is going to process that information and result in five
different types of analysis:
1. How many times each of those letters they have chosen appears. To achieve this, I
advise you to store those letters in a list, and then use a method of strings that allows
you to count how many times a substring appears within the string. One thing to keep
in mind is that when searching for letters, there can be upper and lower case and this
will affect the result. So, to make sure that absolutely all letters are counted, you should
pass both the original text and the letters to be searched to lowercase.
2. How many words are in the whole text? To achieve this part, remember that there is
a string method that allows us to transform it into a list. And then there is a function
that allows us to find out the length of a list.
3. What are the first and last letters of the text? Here, we will clearly use indexing.
4. The system will show us how the text would look like if we inverted the order of the
words. Is there any method that allows us to invert the order of a list? And another one
that allows us to join these elements with spaces in between?
5. The system will tell us if the word “python” is inside the text. This part can be a bit
complicated to imagine, but I'll give you a hint: you can use Booleans to make your
enquiry and a dictionary to find ways to express your answer.*

The challenge focuses on __*lists, dictionaries, tuples and sets*__ and __*booleans*__ function for the day.
