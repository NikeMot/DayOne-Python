# 16 Day Python Learning Challenge
## Learning Python via small projects

## Day One 
The requirements for the first day, from "*Total Python: You Can Master Python Programming in 16 Days*" on Udemy can be seen below:

>*You're going to create Python code that asks your friend to answer two questions that
require a single word each and then displays those combined words on the screen to
form a creative brand.*

The challenge focuses on the __*input*__ and __*print*__ functions for the day.
As the days go by, I will be coming back to this project to update it and add any other knowledge I learned after it 

## Day Two 

The requirements for the second day, from "*Total Python: You Can Master Python Programming in 16 Days*" on Udemy can be seen below:

>*The situation is this: You work in a company where salespeople receive 13%
commissions on their total sales, and your boss wants you to help the salespeople
calculate their commissions by creating a program that asks them their name and
how much they've sold this month.
Your program will answer them with a sentence that includes their name and the
amount of commissions they are entitled to*

The challenge focuses on the __*mathematical operators*__ and the __*round*__ function for the day.
As always, as the days go by, I will be coming back to this project to update it and add any other knowledge I learned after it
